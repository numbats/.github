## About the NUMBATs organisation 👋

This organisation maintains a suite of repos that are used for teaching at Monash University, primarily in the Business Analytics offerings.

The templates for teaching materials are housed at https://github.com/quarto-monash.

Members are teaching staff in Econometrics and Business Statistics, and are able to create new repos, and provide access to outside members.
